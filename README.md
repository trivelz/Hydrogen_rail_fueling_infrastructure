# Hydrogen_rail_fueling_infrastructure
Python code of paper "Designing an optimized fueling infrastructure for a hydrogen railway system" (A.Trivella, A.Balha , D.Guericke). Journal of Rail Transport Planning &amp; Management 35 (2025), 100524.

The code runs an algorithm for optimizing the design of the fueling infrastructure of a hydrogen railway system, i.e., it optimally places fueling dispensers and H2 storage systems in predefined areas within railway yards, and connects them with pipelines, such that the expected H2 demand is satisfied while several constraints are fulfilled and costs are minimized. The code takes as input cost parameters, a macro-scale rail network composed of stations and yards, and a detailed representation of each yard. It requires the areas in the yards where fueling dispensers and H2 storage systems can be installed as a set of polygons given by the coordinates of their corners. It solves either a full mixed-integer linear program (which can be inefficient) or a faster matheuristic method.
